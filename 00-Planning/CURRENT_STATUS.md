## 📋 Known Issues & Notes

### Current Known Issues
None at this time. Build 46 resolves all identified UX issues.

### Design Decisions Made
1. **Sticky buttons for primary actions** - Prevents hidden CTA issues
2. **Haptics on all interactions** - Provides tactile feedback
3. **AppFeedback over SnackBars** - Consistent, categorized user messages
4. **AlertDialog with actions** - Dialog buttons always visible
5. **"How It Works" separate screens** - Frees up screen space
6. **Dynamic QR codes with refresh** - Security through time-limited tokens
7. **Supplier vs Issuer terminology** - "Supplier" is correct for P2P model

### Technical Debt
- None identified. Recent refactoring eliminated inconsistencies.
